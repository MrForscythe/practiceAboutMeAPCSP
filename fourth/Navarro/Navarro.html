          <p>
            I grew up playing 1st person and 3rd person videogames. My dad owned a Xbox360 and I would play Call of Duty zombies all day everyday. During quarantine I would play a lot of video games and I decided to start a YouTube channel for fun. I randomly came up with a name and ended up with PizzaKing. Most people in my grade know me as PizzaKing because I would tell people I used to do YouTube. At one point I took YouTube serious and then I gave up.
