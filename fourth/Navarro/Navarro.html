  <p style="text-align: center;"> When I was 3 years old I played my first ever video game Lego Batman. Playing lego batman was one of my favorite things to do growing up. Video games were actually fun back then when Xbox360 was out. Call of Duty Zombies is also something I would play a lot. </section>
