        Hi, my name is Christopher Arciniega, and as of writing this piece, I'm a high school senior at 18 years old! I like playing video or board games,
        traveling abroad, and cycling! As I live in Chicago, it is nice to live in a city with so many ways to travel, with so much diversity in the people 
        and urban environment! One issue I like to focus in particular is the issue of Chicago's public transit system, as its service is as good as a snake-oil 
        salesman in reliability, and their stations need to just get cleaner in general! I hate the bus shelters too, for how little there actually are and how 
        bare-bones they can be. This is the deal with me, myself, and I.
