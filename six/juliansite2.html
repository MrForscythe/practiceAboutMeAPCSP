    <h1>My Interest in Rugby</h1>
    <p>This is where I'll talk about my interest in rugby.</p>
    
    <p> I joined the rugby team at Noble Street in 2024 (This year) and yea I was scared but
        after i got hit by a 6ft 250 lb man, i got used to it. </p>

    <p> I immediatly fell in love and already loved this sport and to be fair, we didn't do 
        good but I enjoyed every second of practice and every game</p>

    <p> Below I will include some pictures (Credited to Isaias Rojas-Espinoza) that shows some
        moments from our game against Rowe Clark.</p>
