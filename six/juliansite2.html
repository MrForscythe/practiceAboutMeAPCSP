    <h1>My Interest in Rugby</h1>
    <p>This is where I'll talk about my interest in rugby and my team as well. </p>

    <p>During the spring of 2024, I joined the Noble Street Rugby team and it also was my first time doing a sport inside a school. 
       It was new and hard work since it was a new sport that I never knew about and was hard getting into it.</p>

    <p>Near the end of the season, I was already getting sad, I started to love this sport and liked being on the pitch as well as the
       physcial contact.</p>

    <p> Below I will include some pictures against our game against Rowe Clark (Photos credited to Isaias Rojas-Espinoza</p>
