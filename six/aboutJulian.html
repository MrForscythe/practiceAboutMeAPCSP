        <h1>Welcome to Julian's Website</h1>


        
        <p>Hello, My name is Julian Cortez, I am 17 years old and I am a Junior (11th) in Noble Street College Prep in my hometown Chicago.</p>



            <p>I would like to be a Nurse when I grow up so I can help people in their day-to-day lives.</p>


            
            <p>I am a very determined person as well as adamant person but when it comes to setting or projects I have to do alone, I have trouble.</p>


            
            <p>While here, did you know, tarantulas not only have their fangs to protect themselves with but have tiny haves that they can flick when they feel threatend. These mostly give you a rash nothing bad and aren't as venomous as people think.</p>
