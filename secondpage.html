    <h2>-Pros of the Internet-</h2>
    <li>Makes it easier to stay connected with family and friends.</li>
    <li>increased access to social services and benefits.</li>
    <li>abundance of information to learn.</li>
    <p>
      The internet allows you to stay connected with people no matter where they
      are in the world through texting, FaceTime, etc. If there is a service you
      need to find (let's say mental health-related or a book club) then the
      internet allows you to do that research and what benefits you. Also, the
      internet gives you access to learn new skills, history, religion, or
      anything you put your mind to. Many ways to do it.

    <h2>-Cons of the Internet-</h2>
    <li>The internet can be addicting and time-wasting.</li>
    <li>spread of fake news and identity theft.</li>
    <li>can lead to physical and mental health issues.</li>
    <p>
      The Internet however has many ways it can waste your time with social
      media, games, etc, making you lose focus and ultimately make you lose your
      time because of how addicting it is to scroll. That leads to physical and
      mental health issues as well. The internet if unkept can make someone lazy
      and complacent. Or they might see something unrealistic online and cause
      them to feel bad about themselves. There are also many dangerous people on
      the internet. People who can hide their identity and manipulate you to
      take something from you. Since your information is online.
