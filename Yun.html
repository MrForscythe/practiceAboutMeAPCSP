           <h2>About me:</h2>
              <p>
                My name is Junzhu Yu, I am 18 years old and live in Chicago, Illinois. 
                I was originally from China when I was in second grade.

                
              <h2>What do I like?</h2>
              <p>
                I love to play video games online with random people. I also like to exercise outside my garden and also bike outside of my neighborhood.

                  data-line="0"
                ></span>
              </p>
              ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              <p>
                I love and used to play ARK: Survival and Metal Gear Rising: Vengence.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h2>Why do we need the Internet?</h2>
              <li>Entertainment</li>
              <p>
                I would watch YouTube for entertainment, such as free time. I don't see video games as entertainment because you have to do work.
              </p>
          
              <li>Online</li>
              <p>
                I talk to people online and also do most of my homework online. I also get help from my boy ChatGPT.
              </p>
              <li>information about me</li>
              <p>
                I originated from China. I came here to the United States when I was 10 years old, so I know how to speak Chinese.
              </p>
              <li>Connection</li>
              <p>
                I know a lot of people from China. A lot of friends, relatives, family members, and a teacher that I still know. I also made a lot of friends in United States.
              </p>
