              <h2>What is the Internet?</h2>
              <p>
                The internet is a network connected globally around the world,
                of cables physically. Things such as TV, phones, and computers
                are connected to the internet all the time, and by browsing on a
                device, we are online.
                <span
                  class="fileopener"
                  data-file="TODO.md"
                  data-line="0"
                ></span>
              </p>
              ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
              <p>
                The internet provides an endless amount of information and answers
                for people around the world. Things such as Wikipedia and Khan
                Academy helps inform and educate people.
              </p>
              <br />
              <br />
              <h2>Why do we need the Internet?</h2>
              <li>Entertainment</li>
              <p>
                We in our everyday lives entertain ourselves through the
                Internet a lot. We use our phones to browse social media and
                plays video games. We also watch on devices such as TV, which
                also requires the internet if not downloaded.
              </p>
          
              <li>Emergency Aid</li>
              <p>
                Emergencies around the world can be life-threatening. Without
                the internet, calls on special services such as the
                firefighters, police officers, and medical personnel cannot be
                achieved without connection.
              </p>
              <li>information</li>
              <p>
                The internet also provides us with the storage and sharing of
                information. It helps us to collect and store historical
                information, such as online newspapers and special events.
                This way, the information is more secure and more organized,
                protected.
              </p>
              <li>Connection</li>
              <p>
                The internet connects the world, allowing countries to
                understand and coordinate better together. Even on a small scale,
                connections happen through sending an email, texting a friend,
                and many more.
              </p>
