# About Me Website

## Overview

Welcome to the About Me Website project! This repository contains the collaborative work of 40 students from two different AP Computer Science Principles (APCSP) classes at Noble Street College Prep. This project aims to develop an engaging and informative personal website for each student, showcasing their unique interests, skills, and aspirations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

1. **Frontend**: The visual and interactive part of the website, developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Backend**: Server-side logic and database management, implemented using whatever github uses!
3. **Database**: Github has got this covered!
4. **Deployment**: Hosting and deployment details, using Github Pages.

## Code of Conduct

We adhere to a strict code of conduct in Mr Forsythe's APCSP classes. Honor is above all else.

## Project Management

We use GitHub Issues and Projects to manage tasks and track progress. Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

- **Browse the Issues** to find tasks that need attention.
- **Create a new Issue** if you identify a bug or have a feature request.
- **Assign yourself to an Issue** and communicate with team members to avoid duplication of work.

## Acknowledgments

Special thanks to all the students in Mr. Forsythe's APCSP classes for their hard work and dedication to this project.
